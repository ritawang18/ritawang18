WORK EXPERIENCE:
- Soaper LLC, Full-Stack Software Engineering Intern                                                                                              May 2025 -- now
  -	Contributed to an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system using Python, TypeScript and PostgreSQL
  -	Developed a React Native patient mobile app that supports 5+ main functions such as appointment scheduling, real-time messaging, automated medical form-filling and medical notes viewing.
  -	Managed a medical database containing 200+ physicians’ and patients’ data using PostgreSQL
  -	Designed and implemented 15+ FastAPI endpoints with Pydantic schemas and OAuth2, eliminating 95% of 400 and 500 auth-related errors across the physician-patient end dataflow 
  -	Built an automated medical form-filling system that supports 10+ types of forms and letters, automating form and letter pre-fill, editing and summarization based on patients’ medical encounters, with 85% of accuracy
  -	Added time zone support to the appointment scheduling logic, making the EMR and patient app fully functional for users in 15+ countries and regions
  -	Refactored the scheduling and form-filling code into a clear Database-API-Service-Frontend structure, cutting the request submission’s latency from 560ms to 150ms, improving code maintainability and scalability

PROJECT EXPERIENCE:
- Washington University, WashU Robotics Club, Hybrid Body Project Team                                                                            Oct 2024 -- now
  -	Created innovative glasses and a haptic vest that use computer vision, haptics and sensing to help the visually impaired navigate indoor spaces
  -	Fine-tuned YOLO v10 and MiDaS models to detect indoor objects and estimate depth, accuracy over 80%.
  -	Built an occupancy grid connected to the MiDaS depth model, identifying obstacles within 5 5-meter of radius
  -	Integrated OpenAI Real Time Console to enable user voice control in object detection
  -	Connected with 2 computer vision professors at WashU and 5+ patients in St. Louis to get feedback. Adjusted Haptics Vest design, monocular depth camera and sensor positions based on patient feedback


- Washington University, Google Developer Student Club, IHO Mobile Clinic Project                                                                 Jan 2025 -- May 2025
  -	Developed an Online Clinic app for the UCLA International Health Organization that supports 60+ patients by deploying openEMR
  -	Redesigned the implemented the frontend UI using Figma, HTML and CSS, creating distinctive and user-friendly interfaces for the International Health Organization
  -	Designed and built 10+ REST API endpoints with OAuth 2.0 authentication that support secure appointment scheduling, medical notes editing and messaging
  -	Implemented real-time messaging using WebSocket, reducing messaging latency to about 300ms per message


- Washington University, Google Developer Student Club, Stomp the World Project                                                                   Oct 2024 -- Dec 2024
  -	Renovated the website for Stomp the World, a St. Louis local non-profit organization
  -	Redesigned UI using Figma and built interactive components such as a photo gallery and a navigation bar using TypeScript, CSS, Flask
